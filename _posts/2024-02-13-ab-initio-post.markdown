Hello! Welcome to this little corner of the internet. 

I aim to use this blog to ~~antagonise~~ develop lines of communication with 
people on either `lobste.rs` or `news.ycombinator.com`, express some ideas or 
start some project. Who knows? I'm new to this. 

A little more about me:
- Former lab analyst at a drug manufacturer (GMP still haunts me to this day). 
- Undertook a Master's degree in Data Science as an excuse to get a programming
job. 
- Did a thesis project with a small music rights management company in Wales. 
- Secured a job with the company after graduation. 
- Started a ML Engineer role with a small drug discovery company afterwards. 
- Left company as it wasn't a great fit for me. 
- Latte art for a while. 
- ???? 
- Still looking for profit. 

I left my old life as a QC analyst for greener pastures and the ability to use
and interact with technology more regularly. I've taken to programming as, well, 
let's be fair, it does pay more, but it's also a fascinating discipline which 
can improve people's work lives and their mental models of problem solving. 

Python and R would be my most professionally experienced languages, but I am 
fascinated with OCaml, Haskell, Rust and C++. Unfortunately, there isn't enough
time to learn all of them, so I'll chad it out and focus on OCaml for now. 

I look forward to whatever this blog leads to in the future.
